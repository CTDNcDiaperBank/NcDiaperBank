Welcome to our CTD summer project! 

To get started, just do the following:

1. This is important - every member of the team needs to fork the repository, even the one who created the organization. 
   No one should be committing directly to the organization repo. You can fork the repo by navigating to the repo's page, and selecting the fork button in the top right.
    
    a.) Once you've forked it, you'll have a new version of the repo under your account. Clone the repo down. MAKE SURE that it's the repo under your name, not the one under the organization.
    
    b.) This is the repo you should be making all your changes in. You'll be adding, committing, and pushing to this repo, and then making "Pull Requests" to the organization repo.

2. Please continue reading over this link http://ryowheatley.blogspot.com/2017/03/simple-github-collaboration-with-lots.html?m=1 start at step 3 under Diagram Break-Collaboration Workflow
